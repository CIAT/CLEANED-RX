field_name,field_type,description
focal_file,character,The filename of the object containing the focal field
focal_path,character,The path to the focal field within the focal object
focal_example_value,character,Example value(s) from the focal field
focal_class,character,The class of data in the focal field
focal_type,character,"Enter one these values:
  1) standard_parameter - values that cannot be changed by users, for example parameters in IPCC tables. Sometimes referred to has hard_coded values by the team.
  2) user_parameter - descriptors of a study area - these filed might be prefilled, but can be changed by users (normally only needs to be done once for a new study area).
  3) user_input - user input, to be changed for each livestock enterprise type and scenario."
focal_userselected,logical,Is the field user selected or entered in the UI (TRUE/FALSE)? FALSE means that the field is auto-populated.
focal_free,logical,Is the field free-text (TRUE/FALSE)? (i.e. it is entered or selected by the user and there is no lookup field)
connected_file,character,The filename of the connected object  (use when focal_free field is FALSE)
connected_path,character,The path to the field in the connected object (use when focal_free field is FALSE)
focal_keyfield,character,"For a field that is autopopulated, what is the path of the key field in the **focal** object that is used to subset the connected table?
  Use when focal_free field is FALSE AND focal_userselected is FALSE.
  Example = the soil_k_value (focal_path) in the input_json comes from the sqlite Soil/k_value field (connected_path), the user selected input_json	soil_description field (e.g. Lixisol) is used to connect the sqlite Soil/k_value.
  This means we enter the value soil_description in the focal_keyfield column and the value Soil/soil_desc in the connected_keyfield column."
connected_keyfield,character,"For a field that is autopopulated, what is the path of the key field in the **connected** table that links to the focal object?
  Use when focal_free field is FALSE AND focal_userselected is FALSE.
  Example = the soil_k_value (focal_path) in the input_json comes from the sqlite Soil/k_value field (connected_path), the user selected input_json	soil_description field (e.g. Lixisol) is used to connect the sqlite Soil/k_value.
  This means we enter the value soil_description in the focal_keyfield column and the value Soil/soil_desc in the connected_keyfield column"
